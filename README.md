## User Interface
The user interface for en.battleship-game.org has two 10x10 grids, individual squares in the grid are identified by letter and number. On one grid the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent. On the other grid the player records his/her own shots. The user places the ship where ever they want within the grid and then click on the other grid that shows where the user has bombed. The visuals and sounds are simple, when a player gets a hit, a cross appears on the square and an explosion sound plays. When a player gets a miss, a dot appears on the square and a sound of a cannon ball hitting the water plays. 

## Gameplay
The mechanics of the game is turn based but when the player gets a hit, they get an extra turn. The game does not allow users to hit/miss on a square they have previously chosen. The goal of the game is to destroy all of the opponentâ€™s ships.
